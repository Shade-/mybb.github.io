### What is a hook?
MyBB comes with a simple yet powerful system which allows third party developers to execute their code into specific areas of its internal files without editing them directly. This is what we call the **hooks system**.

A hook is basically a line of code with a unique identifier, usually a string, placed in a specific point of a file at which every function "associated" to it is executed once.
